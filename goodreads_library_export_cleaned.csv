Definitely, my favorite read of the year (it's only January, but it will still be very hard to top this book). When I read the first book, James became my favorite character, mainly because he was Will's son, but in this book, he grew so much and I felt for him, to the point that throughout the book I would wait for his point of view part of the chapter. Matthew on the other hand is an exact replica of young will Heronadale which is truly devastating. I knew I'm supposed to feel bad for Grace, and her predicament, but........... Christopher is way toooooo good for her. seriously hated the fact that they might end up together. The last thing, this is definitely the longest I've ever ranted in a review, the miscommunication trope! All James and Coredila needed to do were just talk to each other, if James told her about the bracelet (there is no such thing as a good time, he could just say it anyway) my blood pressure wouldn't be so high, but I guess that the whole point!<br/>P.S. Is it normal to ship a girl with her ghost lover?? Their whole relationship barely made any sense but I still loved them together.",1,"The Last Hours, #2"

One question. why on earth is this such a popular book? It's seriously an awful one. Tate was a dramatic whiny pathetic fool, the whole book she just lets Miles walk all over her. Even though she already knows what she agreed to she keeps trying to change Miles and finds ways to make him fall for her and cries when he rejects her!!!!!! Regarding Miles, I did feel like he's the main character and his character was far more interesting but he was still in dire need of therapy. The only reason this book got an extra star is because of Miles and Rachel's back story, it was truly sad.",1,

The book dragged and dragged and I felt like there were a lot of unnecessary things going on you. It also felt like the author had something against Yasmine! The chemistry between the main leads was non-existent, plus it felt like their romance was rushed. And the second lead couple, which we got a lot of hints about, never actually happened! The main reason I was able to get through it because of the lion of the night. Now he was an interesting character. I’m always attracted to dark and twisty characters. His reason for vengeance, in a way, was plausible.",1,"Sands of Arawiya, #2"

I honestly wished this series never ended. It was too good. I literally devoured this book in like a day. Quan was seriously the best male character in the whole series, the way he was always there for everybody was........ no words. Anna on the other hand was the most complex female character so far, which automatically made her a favorite. I really like it when characters are flawed, they just make them more relatable.

Plus you cant deny that <b>HE</b> made the book far more interesting than it ever was ( or you can deny that totally your choice my friend).<br/>Another reason as to why i enjoyed the book is the plot which was very interesting, exciting, engaging...etc. And the rather interesting twists also can not be forgotten.<br/>However there was a couple of things that kinda let me down. Not very much to lower my rating though.<br/>The first reason is that the book was kinda slow. Kept waiting for the villain to come and she didn't until that last 15 chapters or so.<br/>The second and most disappointing is Tamlin. I know i know lots of people out there love him. I Kept hoping maybe as the story proceed i will fall for him. But as the story continue i liked him less and less. Not only do i dislike him because he is quite boring but also because i doubt he loves Feyre that he claims to does. Or the way she loves him.<br/>All in all, I'm totally looking forward to 2nd book. hopefully there is more Rhysand and maybe even Lucien, he isn't a horrible character if i must admit, scenes.<br/><br/>P.S. Am i the only one whose suspicious because Rhysand <i>stumbled</i>???<br/><br/><blockquote> ""Be glad of your human heart, Feyre. Pity those who don't feel anything at all."" </blockquote>",1,"A Court of Thorns and Roses, #1"

Honestly, throughout the book, I thought it will definitely be 4 stars, but I was reminded why she is a very hyped author. The character development in the book was perfect, it was definitely the highlight for me. The book was a definite slow burn. the last 200 hundred pages were utter perfection. I'm still not quite a fan of the writing, but the world-building and characters and their chemistry made up for it. Ruhn is definitely my favorite.
